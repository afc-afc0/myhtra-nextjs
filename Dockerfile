# Needed because: By changing the ownership of the .next directory, we are ensuring that the nextjs
# user has the necessary permissions to read from and write to this directory.
# This is needed for because Next.js needs to access and potentially modify files in this directory during runtime.
# Also: Setting the correct ownership helps maintain the principle of least privilege. 
# The application runs as the nextjs user, so it should only have access to the directories 
# and files it needs to function.
